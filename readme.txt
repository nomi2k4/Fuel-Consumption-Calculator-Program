Fuel Consumption Calculator Program:

This C++ program was written to calculate the estimated fuel consumption for a given distance in miles, both in-town and on-highway.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input the distance in miles
- Calculates the estimated fuel consumption for in-town driving (0.0465 gallons/mile)
- Calculates the estimated fuel consumption for on-highway driving (0.0373 gallons/mile)
- Displays the results

Features:

- User input for distance in miles
- Use of multiplication operator for fuel consumption calculations
- Clear and informative output

Assumptions:

- In-town fuel consumption rate: 0.0465 gallons/mile
- On-highway fuel consumption rate: 0.0373 gallons/mile

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./fuel_consumption_calculator
    - On Windows: fuel_consumption_calculator.exe
4. Enter the distance in miles when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using floating-point variables and arithmetic operators
- Working with basic calculations and fuel consumption rates
- Basic program structure and syntax
